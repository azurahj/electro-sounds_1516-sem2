#Describe in 150 words why you like this project.

This project,imposition is an audio and visual interaction between two artists,electronic musician Edisonnoside and visual artist Daniel Schwarz.The general idea of this whole project is regarding the interaction between the visual and audio interplay with each other that compliments giving an added aesthetic.

In terms of audio,it has melodic and rhythmic aspects.The different sounds embodies different textures and space with sounds in the background and foreground.The transition between the different segments is smooth and relatable keeping a few similar sonic characteristics along its transitions.

In terms of visuals,showing them only on the rods and not on a flat screen allows more variation for the visuals by manipulating the visual space.This correspond to their idea of ‘play with the perception of space and reality’. In addition,the visuals are not always projected all the time,gives the audience a sense of different spaces. 

##Then describe in your own words how the project works technically.

The visuals for the project respond to the beats and melody.Based on the intensity of the audio, the visuals will react accordingly to manipulate the spaces in between the rods for the more aesthetic accompaniment. Below are the few technical aspects in creating the visuals:-

Midi Controllers : The use of a MIDI controller allows the user more control over the parameters that the visuals are being assigned to.This gives more live interaction between the user and visuals.

Beat detection : Having this function allows the visuals to be audio reactive where it reacts according to the beats of the song. Also known as a minim.

Class : Creating different class of objects. This allows better grouping and easier to identify the different elements in the code.

Visual Mapping : This function allows to map the visuals only to the rods.Gives more versatility in manipulating the space and not merely projection.
