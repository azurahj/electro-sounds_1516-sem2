# General Idea

The main idea circulates around the poles as the main visual. This creates a space as it is you are watching a live performance. Also the element of live control of the changes within the different scenes. Visuals are very minimal with an abstract noise piece as the audio to accompany the visuals.Really like the idea of focusing the visuals instead of having it fill the whole screen and of course controlling it live.

## Components of the visuals

Poles that represents the visuals. It is reactive to sound which I use Minim for this function.
There are total of 3 different scenes. First is the rectangle inside the poles, a flickering triangle and finally lines that takes shape of the poles.
also Iâ€™ve added a full black screen to play with visual perception.
Last but not least, the slight tilt of the camera angle towards the left and right. This shows a different perspective of the poles instead of just looking at it from the front.


### Reference Idea

The reference is from Daniel Schwarz, imposition.
Like the idea of playing with dimension
